# Weather Forecast APP
//Live site link will go here

# Summary
This is phase 1 of my weather forecast app. Thus far I have been able to make a request to the Open Weather Map API using the current weather API and set up index.ejs and weather.ejs to view response as HTML file.
- Current weather data API doc: https://openweathermap.org/current
- The code for this can be found in the app_1.js file

Phase 2 of my weather forecast app involves making a request to the Open Weather Map API using the 5 day weather forecast API.
