# Weather Forecast APP
//Live site link will go here

# Summary
This is my weather forecast app. Thus far I have been able to make a request to the Open Weather Map API using the weather forecast API and set up index.ejs and weather.ejs to view response as HTML file.
- 5 day weather forecast API docs:
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#name5
- The forecast API is a 5 day forecast available at any location or city. It includes weather data every 3 hours.
- The code for this can be found in the app.js file

- Current issue: attempting to split the JSON reponse into 5 different arrays, where array 1 has data from day 1 etc.
Example if the date is the 1st of September, I want array 1 (day 1) to contain data for the 1st of september, array 2 to contain data for 2nd of september etc.
